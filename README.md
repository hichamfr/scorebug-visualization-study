# 📺 Scorebug Visualization Study

This project explores how football broadcasts and media communicate the state of a match using **scorebugs** — the small overlays that show the score, time, and events. I collected and analyzed examples from **live TV**, **web apps**, **newspapers**, and **social media**, and then designed a new version of the scorebug based on what I learned.

## 🧠 What I Analyzed

I studied 11 scorebugs from:
- 🎥 **Live TV broadcasts** (World Cup, La Liga, Champions League, etc.)
- 🌐 **Web platforms** like Flashscore
- 📰 **Print media** from L'Équipe newspaper
- 📱 **Instagram** match recap graphics

Each was reviewed for:
- Clarity  
- Information shown  
- Layout and usability  
- Viewer experience  

---

## 👎 What Didn't Work

- Some designs (like Morocco vs Gabon) were too big and unclear  
- Yellow/red card alerts disappeared too quickly  
- Some showed only the logo or only the team name  

---

## ✅ What I Liked

- Small, top-left layout that doesn't block play  
- Both logo + name are shown together  
- Designs that match the competition's theme (e.g., World Cup styling)  

---

## 🎨 My Redesign Idea

I designed a new live scorebug that:
- Appears in the **top-left corner**  
- Shows **score, time, team name, and logo**  
- Plays a **small animation** for yellow/red cards with the player’s name/number  
- Changes style depending on the competition theme (e.g., World Cup, UEFA)  
- Becomes **transparent** if action happens behind it (like EA FC does)

## 💾 Data & Metadata

See `metadata.csv` for details on each example:
- Screenshot name  
- Date  
- Match  
- Source  
- Notes

## 📌 Goal

The goal of this study is to improve how match information is shown to viewers, especially during **live games**, by learning from the best features of existing scorebugs and fixing common problems.
